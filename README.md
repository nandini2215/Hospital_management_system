AI-Powered Disease Prediction and Patient Management System

Overview
This project is an AI-driven disease prediction and patient management system designed to provide real-time disease predictions based on user-reported symptoms and facilitate efficient doctor-patient consultations. Leveraging a trained Random Forest Machine Learning model, the system offers an interactive and user-friendly experience for both patients and medical professionals.

Built with a Flask-based backend and a React.js (or similar) frontend, the project integrates MySQL for robust database management and ensures seamless interaction between users and the system.

Key Features
üè• User Roles
Patients:
- Register and log in securely.
- Input symptoms and receive AI-based disease predictions.
- Request doctor consultations.
- View medical history and previous consultations.
- Log out securely.

Doctors:
- View patient details and symptom history.
- Review AI-generated disease predictions.
- Provide medical advice through consultation records.
- Access patient medical history.

Admin:
- Manage doctor and patient accounts.
- View and assign doctors to patient consultation requests.

ü§ñ AI-Based Disease Prediction
- Utilizes a trained Random Forest Model for disease prediction based on input symptoms.
- Preprocesses user input using a scaler ('random_scaler.pkl') before feeding it into the model.
- Uses 'Training.csv' dataset containing symptoms and corresponding diseases for accurate predictions.

üîó Backend (Flask API & MySQL Database)
The Flask backend offers RESTful API endpoints for:
- User authentication and session management.
- Storing and retrieving medical records.
- Processing and storing AI-based disease predictions.

MySQL 8.0 Database stores:
- Patient details and medical history.
- Doctor profiles and assigned consultations.
- Disease prediction results with timestamps.

üé® Frontend (User Interface - React.js or Equivalent)
- User-friendly web interface for symptom input, doctor consultations, and medical history tracking.
- Intuitive dashboards for patients and doctors.
- Real-time display of disease prediction results.
